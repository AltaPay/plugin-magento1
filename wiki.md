payment methods and configuring payments.

![altapay_magento1_plugin_configuration](docs/altapay_magento1_plugin_configuration.jpg)

2. Define the gateway URL, username and password (URL for test environment is https://testgateway.altapaysecure.com).
3. Enable the **Use Single Orderline** option, recommended if you have complex pricing, tax, or discount configurations to avoid order line mismatches.
4. Select option for "Fail Payment Action" dropdown. 
    -   <strong>Redirect to Cart Page</strong> - This will redirect user to cart page
    -   <strong>Redirect to Fail Page</strong> - This will redirect user to fail page 
5. Save the config to have the plug-in to pull a list of available terminals.
6. For each of the Gateway groups, you have the following options:

![altapay_magento1_plugin_terminal_configuration](docs/altapay_magento1_plugin_terminal_configuration.jpg)

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Enable</strong></td>
    <td>Enable the payment method in the checkout.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Terminal</strong></td>
    <td>Here you select the appropriate terminal.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Title</strong></td>
    <td>Define the title shown in the checkout (this will not affect the name used other places, e.g. the e-mail send to customers).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Payment Action</strong></td>
    <td>Here you define if only an authorization should take place, or if the transaction should be captured immediately.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>AVS</strong></td>
    <td>Enable Address Verification process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Enforce AVS</strong></td>
    <td>If payment method does not provide AVS due to some reason, transaction will be rejected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>AVS accepted codes</strong></td>
    <td>Here you specify AVS Codes which you would like to accept. (comma separated)*</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Sort Order</strong></td>

## Customization

It is possible to customize various aspects of the plug-in. Below is a list with the most relevant files.

- Render the payment page. <br> `app/design/frontend/base/default/template/altapay/checkout/form.phtml`
- Style the payment form <br> `app/design/frontend/base/default/template/altapay/checkout/magento_styling.css`
- Display a failed page to the customer <br> `app/design/frontend/base/default/template/altapay/checkout/failed.phtml`
- Define what is stated as the payment method in the consumer’s e-mail <br> `app/design/frontend/base/default/template/altapay/payment/info/gateway.phtml`

> _Note: All customized files are subject of change when installing new version of the plug-in. Keep in mind to backup and merge modified
files during installation._

# Supported versions
- Magento 1 minimum supported version by the plugin is currently Magento CE 1.9.x 
- PHP supported versions: 5.4.x - 5.6.x


# Troubleshooting

**PHP Warning: Input variables exceeded 1000. To increase the limit change max_input_vars in php.ini.**

For orders that contain too many products, this PHP warning may be issued. You will need to:

- Open your php.ini file
- Edit the max_input_vars variable. This specifies the maximum number of variables that can be sent in a request. The default is 1000. Increase it to, say, 3000.
- Restart your server.

**Parameters: description/unitPrice/quantity are required for each orderline, but was not set for line: xxxx**
> The same problem as above. The request is being truncated because the number of variables are exceeding the max_input_vars limit.


## Providing error logs to support team

You can find the logs from the below path:

**CMS logs:** <br>
`<Magento directory>/var/logs/altapay{DATE}.log` where {DATE} represents the date when the log is created. For each date new log is created.

![altapay_magento1_logs](docs/altapay_magento1_logs.png)

**Web server error logs:**

**For Apache server** You can find it on **/var/log/apache2/error.log**

**For Nginx** it would be **/var/log/nginx/error.log**

**_Note: Your path may vary from the mentioned above._**
